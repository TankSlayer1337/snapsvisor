# Wish I could tie

*Melodi: Hej Tomtegubbar*

Wish I could tie a string,  
a-round the snaps fore I drink it!  
Wish I could tie a string,  
a-round the snaps fore I drink it!  

When it goes down, I pull the string,  
And thus reuse it, thatâ€™s why I sing.  
Wish I could tie a string,  
a-round the snaps fore I drink it!
