# Johnny comes marching home
*Melodi: Johnny comes marching home*

When Johnny comes marching home again  
Hurrah, hurrah!  
We'll give him a hearty welcome then  
Hurrah, hurrah!  
The men will cheer, the boys will shout,  
The ladies, they will all turn out,  
And we'll all feel gay when  
Johnny comes marching home.  

The old church bell will peal with joy  
Hurrah, hurrah!  
To welcome home our darling boy  
Hurrah, hurrah!  
The village lads and lassies say,  
With roses they will strew the way,  
And we'll all feel gay when  
Johnny comes marching home.
